Welcome to the House Price Prediction Project! In this project, we leverage Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to predict house prices based on various factors.

Project Overview
Have you ever wondered what influences house prices in different areas? Factors such as location, property size, and number of bedrooms can all impact a property's value. Our House Price Prediction Project dives into these questions and provides accurate predictions using Machine Learning.

With the help of advanced models, we explore the real estate market, allowing you to gain valuable insights into house price trends.

Key Features
🧹 Data Preprocessing
We have taken care of cleaning and transforming the dataset, ensuring it's ready for model training and evaluation.

📈 Data Visualization
Interactive visualizations are available to help you explore how various features like location, area, and other factors influence house prices.

🤖 Machine Learning Models
This project utilizes a variety of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms such as:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
These models are designed to predict house prices with high accuracy.

📊 Model Evaluation
We evaluate our models using performance metrics like:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
These metrics help us assess how well the models predict house prices.

Project Setup
To set up and run the project locally, follow these instructions:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mohankrishna264/House-Price-Prediction.git
```

With the project now set up, you're just a few commands away from uncovering the secrets of real estate data.
